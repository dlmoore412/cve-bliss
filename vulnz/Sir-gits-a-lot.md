# Chainguard go and alpine Comparison using Grype

This is an example comparison of using golang alpine and Chainguard based images performed on Nov 18, 2024 for the Chainguard course "Painless Vulnerability Management" Final Project Option 1 (Technical).

The results show that Alpine has 12 vulnerabilities and Chainuard as 0 vulerabilites.

1. `alpine` (12 (2 fixed, 10 not-fixed) vulnerabilites)

```
 ✔ Scanned for vulnerabilities     [12 vulnerability matches]  
   ├── by severity: 2 critical, 2 high, 6 medium, 0 low, 0 negligible (2 unknown)
   └── by status:   2 fixed, 10 not-fixed, 0 ignored 
```

2. `FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/go:latest` (0 vulnerabilites0)

```
 ✔ Scanned for vulnerabilities     [0 vulnerability matches]  
   ├── by severity: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 0 low, 0 negligible
   └── by status:   0 fixed, 0 not-fixed, 0 ignored 
No vulnerabilities found
```

### Docker build with golang-alpine (Step 3: Build the Image)

```
docker build . -t container-golang-server
```
